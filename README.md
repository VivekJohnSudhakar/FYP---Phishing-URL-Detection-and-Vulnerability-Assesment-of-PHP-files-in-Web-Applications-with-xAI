# PHISHING URL DETECTION AND VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT OF WEB APPLICATIONS USING IVS ATTRIBUTES WITH xAI
This project helps in detection of pphishing URL's as well as input validation based vulnerabilities i.e sqli,xss and fi from php code. Phishing URL detection is performed using a 
SVM model. For vulnerability prediction, after the sources are identified from the AST a set of IVS attributes using string matching are extracted. These attributes are then used as indicators to predict the existence of vulnerabilities using XGBoost models. The results and models are then explained through XAI.
